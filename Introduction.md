# Introduction

## How to Read this Book
When Ray Dalio wrote his book _Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed and Fail_ he wrote the following:

> - In writing this book I wrestled with whether to make it complete or concise and decided to try to make it both by bolding passages to create a quick-read version. **If you want to read the concise version, read what is in bold, and if you want more, it‚Äôs all available to you.**
> - I also wanted to convey some principles that are timeless and universal truths for dealing with reality well, which I denoted by üî¥ _**putting a red dot in front of them and italicizing**_.
> - For some subjects, I had embellishments that I thought would be interesting to some but not all readers, so I chose to present them as an addendum to the respective chapter. Feel free to read or skip as you like.
> - At the back of this book, you can find a glossary that explains the abbreviations you see in some of the charts.

I shall follow the same convention as Dalio. If you want to read the concise version of the book, skip anything unbolded.

## Purpose of this Book
This book seeks to distill the idea of "how to get a girlfriend" into a basic procedure that should be easy to understand, distributed in an open [[license]] (GNU FDL). In writing this book I will consult a variety of different resources such as research papers, in-person interviews, and other books/video series in order to make this book the most up-to-date and relevant resource possible. Ideally, this should be the only resource you will ever need.


## First Principles
First principles are the basic, fundamental assumptions we must have in order to proceed. As much as these may be "first principles," they are subject to change, and 
### 1. There is immense pressure for a man to get a girlfriend at some point in his life.
Imagine the statement "you need to get a girlfriend." Technically, you don't need to, but you are reading this book. There are a variety of reasons for this. One is the actual reasons, which are known only to you, whether consciously or unconcsiously. The second is the societal pressure. The societal pressure is easier to break down, so I will cover it first (see section Pressure from Family). These pressures come from family, friends, and the rest of society.

#### Pressure from Family
##### Pressure from Parents
**Your parents want you to reproduce at some point. Preferably in a way that allows you to have a family.**
According to [[Biology]], [[Fitness]] refers to the number of offspring an organism can produce in a lifetime [^1]. But it is not only important to produce children; it is important to produce children that eventually reproduce. From an evolutionary standpoint, there is a very real incentive for a parent to encourage children to find a mate.

Parents may say things like this: (have you ever heard these?)

> Father: Now that you are going into university, your task is to eventually find a job. But you must also find a girlfriend (or boyfriend, if you are a girl). That is one of your biggest priorities.

(Upon learning of your grades)
> Father: With grades as low as these, it is only excusable if you are chasing after a girl.
> Son: K.
> Father: (pauses for a moment) But only if you are chasing her like, to death. (The father did not want his son to nominally chase a girl as a license to have bad grades.)

(Upon learning that you are meeting up with friends)
> Father: Are there any girls there?
> Son: No.
> Father: So you all plan to be monks together?

The ones above may have been experienced by many different people. But my friend has experienced this one before: 
(My friend invites us to his house every week. His father asks if there are any girls there, to which my friend responds in the negative.)
> Father: What are you all, gay?

Here we run into a bit of an issue. This is the issue of [[masculinity]]. What defines a man? What does it mean to be manly? This is a topic people have struggled with for eons. Masculinity was a crucial theme in Shakespeare's _Macbeth_. Shouldn't we be moving away from the traditional perceptions of men? Isn't it sexist to expect men to be chasing women? And what of women chasing men? If one party chases the other, does it imply a predator/prey relationship? If not, why call it a "chase?"

The other issue is the idea of shame. Didn't we leave homophobia in the past? Why is it used as an insult, an annoyance, to spur a child to do something the parent wants? And above all, should a child feel shame for not wanting to reproduce? If my friend's father didn't call him gay, he may have said "coward" or something along those lines. (Or, apparently, "monks.") Is this ethical?

Interestingly, monogamy is generally encouraged as opposed to polygamy
Unless you are surrounded by the "hyper bro-culture" people. Parents generally encourage monogamy for their children as it is not as associated with sexually risky behaviours.

##### Pressure from Siblings
At the moment, I haven't heard of siblings pressuring their siblings into reproducing. But it could happen. Remember that since you share substantial DNA with your siblings, they may encourage you to reproduce as a means of passing down their genes. 

I have heard of this ridiculous line before. The sibling in question was a girl who apparently just had her boyfriend come over to meet the family.
> Sister: "Hey, you should get a girlfriend! That way we can gossip with her all about you!"
> Brother: "Yeah, and it'll be like a [[commodity]]. Doesn't matter which girlfriend you get, as long as you get one."

According to the person (the brother), a second sister was present, also supporting the pressure. Regardless, after the brother said his line about "commodities" the two siblings did not seem happy, but did not respond. It seems the brother may have been angered by the notion of his childhood embarassments being leaked to a girl he took interest in.

The idea of commodities is very important. Why is it that you are encouraged to find a "one?" It seems rather odd when you think about it. And when a man actively searches for a relationship, doesn't it make it quite inorganic? (That is, he may force something to work, or convince himself he is in love, because he is under pressure to make something work.) **The ethics of "girlfriend hunting" are very important and society should resolve this issue at some point.**

##### Other Family Pressures
Pressures from extended family may also exist. No one wants to be the cousin who is unmarried and jobless. 
Incidentally, I have heard such an account before. The source's cousin (about 20-30 years older than him) was jobless and unmarried. As a result, the source's father would complain about him every day at the dinner table, and would constantly tell the source not to end up like him. Interestingly, the issue of being single was considered worse than being jobless (partially because the cousin had worked odd jobs as a contractor before).

**Being single has a heavy stigma that many are unwilling to admit. Choosing to be single for life is considered even more shameful, and could make someone the black sheep of the family, or a pariah.**

#### Pressure from Friends
I don't have much to say here. I've never really observed friends calling out other friends for being single. Although in many circles, getting a girlfriend would be seen as a "W." Something to be proud of, and something everyone else would be impressed by.

Once I was at my friend's house, with a few other friends there. This exchange occured:

Me: Why would someone get a girlfriend?
Friend A: So you can have sex.
Friend B: Yeah, exactly.
Friend C: Well no, you can get married, then you can have a family.
A and B: No, no, no.
Me: If you want sex, can‚Äôt you just do it with a prostitute?
Friend A: Well it [sex with a significant other] is free, and you can do it whenever you want. (The latter is not always a true assumption. Besides, I'm not sure how much people like being the "booty call.")
Friend B: Yeah. And there is a reduced risk of STDs.
Friend C: Well actually you can get married, then you can have a family, then you can leave a legacy. (As he spoke his voice became quieter and quieter and he began to shake his head and wave his hand a bit. It was as if he had given up on convincing my friends.)
Friend A: Well that‚Äôs what they want you to think, but the reality is different. (He seemed to allude to some sort of taboo truth.)
At this point a debate sparked. A while later:
Me: Well what if someone doesn‚Äôt care about sex?
Friend A: Well then he‚Äôs a virgin. (This was spoken with contempt.)
Friend B: Well he‚Äôs a virgin, exactly. (By this point B vehemently agreed with A, especially after the debate that just happened.)
Me: Well by definition, yes.
Friend A: That would be like someone who does programming.
Friend D: Hey! I‚Äôm being attacked!
Friend D was majoring in computer engineering and math. He was an Asian with glasses and he was currently doing a paid co-op placement as a Python programmer. He was also about 5 foot 6 inches tall. We realized that this conversation was uncovering some uncomfortable truths.
I said, ‚Äúwell statistically, that is the case.‚Äù I was thinking of the [[Aphrodite project]] where a massive proportion of people were computer science majors. 
The conversation fizzled out there as we did not want to insult our short computer science friend. I had not asked them about friends-with-benefits, although in hindsight I should have. I also did not ask them about "self-relief" measures, although I could probably guess what they would say about that.

Macabre Storytelling paints a similar story in his video. "Having had minimal sexual and dating experience, seeing a number of my male peers have success with women  resulted in me developing a number of personal insecurities which led me to the seduction community in order to dispel them." [^10]

#### Pressure from Society in General
Have you noticed that [[Instagram]] has the most negative effect on mental health?[^2]
(Incidentally, Youtube had a slight positive effect. This is likely because Youtube is mostly educational, infotainment, or entertainment.)
It helps to remember that Instagram is a machine that feeds on jealousy. Instagram statisticians likely figured that the best way to keep users scrolling for extended periods was to arouse envy.
This could be done in a number of ways.
For some, wealth/money/status symbols... and then you see gurus promoting stock picking courses and other get-rich-quick schemes. 
It could be vacation photos.
It could be people advertising unrealistic bodies (photoshopped, drugged, surgery-modified, etc.) for financial gain (courses, supplements, makeup lines)
It could be relationships (people posting photos with their ex), or social status (people posing at parties, nightclubs, or other get-togethers).
It always bothered me that people liked to make their life so public. Did they want attention or validation? Instagram is a highlight reel machine. Did they want to create jealousy in others by "flexing" and bragging with highlight reels? Was this not a vain pursuit?

I have heard valid counterarguments before. One girl I knew told me (with regards to Instagram causing mental health issues) that it had to do with expectations. She told me "well of course it is a highlight machine. But the feed is also curated to you. If you cognitively know the pictures are fake and don't fall for it, you are fine. As for me, I don't get photoshopped models in my feed. I just get cooking tutorials."

I have nothing in response to this. Many often use Instagram as Pinterest, and that is totally fine to me.

Another girl told me "I post pictures of my friends and our get-togethers because it is like a scrapbook. I want to keep track of our memories and where we have been. [. . .]  One time, my friend was mad at me and texted me angrily asking why I had posted the photos where she looked ugliest. I told her my reasons (I want to keep track of the memories, not flex on people, which is why the group photos often have some people not ready for them). The next day when she showed up at school, she talked to me as if our text exchange had never occurred and that she hadn't been yelling at me. I was quite hurt by this, and she seemed quite superficial. I still care about her a lot though."

To this I also did not know what to say. I had spotty relations with her "friend" in question who seemed to care a bit too much of how other people perceived her, as if she was playing some sort of status and beauty game, of which Instagram was one prong. 

#### Key takeaways from these pressures
##### Mental Health is Very Important
I will echo Dr. K's sentiment. **Mental health is very important, and it is essential that as you embark on this journey, you take care of yourself. Do not measure your self-worth by arbitrary statistics like bodycount and success rate.** 

##### Society is very bad at addressing these issues
Men's dating struggles are a problem that hides in plain sight. Society is very bad at providing help for men who get sucked into mysogynistic pickup communities. 
According to Macabre Storytelling ("Male Dating & Sex Struggles: A Problem In Plain Sight"), "Such discussions often devolve into a clusterfuck of emotionally charged vitreol with terms such as "feminism, MRAs, incels, toxic masculinity" and what not undoubtedly being tossed around, while the actual pressing questions are left by the wayside. Namely, what are the difficulties that men face when it comes to dating and sex, what leads to them being plagued by in some cases debilitating insecurities, why are the current avenues that address these issues riddled with toxicity, and how can we address this problem so we can make a better world for everyone?"[^11]

> The problem with telling a guy who is inexperienced beyond a certain age(somewhere around 18-19) 'be yourself' is that being himself means being alone. An inexperienced guy is himself when he's just himself. He doesn't know at all what being himself with a person he's attracted to means. He's gonna answer 'myself means wearing casual clothes in my room and watching a movie with no one else to talk to'. It most certainly is not to go out on a date.
> -Florin Ivan, as commented in "Male Dating & Sex Struggles: A Problem In Plain Sight"

> Saying "be confident" to someone with low confidence is like saying, "be happy" to a depressed person. If it were easy, I wouldn't have asked for the advice.
> -Entropic Alloy, as commented in "Male Dating & Sex Struggles: A Problem In Plain Sight"

> I once told my sister about the physical, psychological, and sexual abuse I suffered at the hands of a former girlfriend.
> My sister would later ask me if I was turning into "one of those incel types", after I made a facebook post for unity of male survivors of rape.
> And people wonder why I didn't come forward sooner.
> Roasted Pheasant, as commented in "Male Dating & Sex Struggles: A Problem In Plain Sight"

> I am a teen girl watching this video from start to finish. It helps me empathise with the men in my life better. It is the first time I heard someone make the case of the society ridiculing men for seeking validation by refusing to extend it to them üòø
> AM, as commented in "Male Dating & Sex Struggles: A Problem In Plain Sight"

> As a young guy who watches too much breadtube/lefty content and is also very unsure of how to approach dating and women it always rubbed me the wrong way to see left wing creators dunk on the redpill types and the manosphere without really offering a viable alternative. I always agreed that they were misogynist asshats who hated women, but it always felt like the left had yet to address the problems they were speaking to.
> I always felt like they just didn't want to admit that the redpill types were right about certain things. Being short makes dating harder, being rich makes dating easier, etc. The advice from the feminists/leftists was that women didn't care about any of that, and the only thing you needed to be successful while dating was be yourself. Its always struck me as utopian and out of touch with reality. I expected misogynists and right-wingers to have this bootstrap mindset that broader social issues don't matter and that individuals should just do their best and never consider or discuss broader societal problems, but hearing feminist or leftists use the same bootstrap rhetoric when it comes to men really stung, especially when they recognize this with other issues and groups. The "just be yourself and act confident, bro" advice so often comes from a position of privilege. Many people giving that advice have never been in the position young men are in today, where we have to initiate, read body language (which vary from person to person), and intuitively know what the other person is thinking. Since I'm also relatively familiar with feminists circles, I know how they put an intense focus on expressed verbal consent with regards to nearly any action in dating. This is largely good, but doesn't always line up to reality. Some women want to be asked before being kissed, others think it ruins the mood. I internalized this feminist idea, and so I asked if it was ok to hold a girls hand, and ended up getting mocked and laughed at by that girl. I still think its the right move to ask if its ok to do something to someone else's body, but I felt like I was lied to and the Redpill folks were the only people who understood that and were willing to meet me in reality. People WILL sometimes act weird if you ask, and for some people, asking does put them in a negative mood. I just wish we on the left could be more honest about this kind of thing instead of lying to young men and giving them false expectation of the world that make them more susceptible to falling down the rabbit hole.
> -Gareth Payne, as commented in "Male Dating & Sex Struggles: A Problem In Plain Sight"


I am sure you are tired of hearing "there is someone out there for everyone" or "you'll find the right person for you." 

##### Ethics are very, very important.
When people start dating, they fall into an "end-goal mindset." "I need to get her on a date." "I need to get her number." This all boils down to "I need to get her to like me." This is where the majority of the manipulation happens, and why PUA techniques get such a bad reputation.
PUAs flip the script. "Just act as if you are the prize and make her chase you."
A better variation is "I want to see if she is someone I would like."[^13] This is not as pretentious as the previous one but preserves the core. This way is more equal.

I define ethics this way: "If everyone in the world acted like me, would the world be a better or worse place?"
The other one I use: "Does my action inflict harm upon anoher person? If yes, don't do it. If no, it is okay."

### 2. If you want a girlfriend, you need to get dates. And if you want dates, you ask someone out. 
This modus operandi is pretty much part of our culture. You get a girlfriend by asking a girl out. There are significant complications that I will discuss later.

One of my siblings asked my sister (the day after meeting her boyfriend) "So who asked who out first?"
She responded "He asked me out."

The first sibling presupposed that it could go both ways. But my sister isn't the type of person who would ask guys out. Come to think of it, many girls wouldn't. There are significant complications associated with a guy asking a girl out. But these complications apply even more for women, because they are likely to be "subtly judged." That is, their female friends would nominally support them for having initiative, but deride her behind her back as being "promiscuous" (ho, thot, and a bunch of other nasty terms which for some reason still have not faded from use).

I should note that if you are learning dating on sites like Youtube, you probably shouldn't go for pickup artist channels. They may feed you some truths to get you in the door, and then keep you stuck with misogynistic beliefs in order to bring you into a sales funnel. They are an industry that preys upon the vulnerable.

A more positive community would be better. For this I would recommend Dr. K's channel, aka HealthyGamerGG. According to his video "Talking with an Incel about Starting a Relationship" the main turnoff for women is a man who is "burdened."[^8] Asking someone out is seen as the modus operandi for getting a girlfriend.[^14] Interestingly enough, Dr. K also uses job applications as an analogy for dating. I will cover this analogy more in-depth later.

In munecat's video, "Diving Down the Sales Funnel of a TikTok Pick-Up Artist," she states: "I think society leads a lot of women to think that society to think that they don't need to approach guys ever . . . they just sort of expect guys to approach them. But girls, I think we sort of need to get out of that headspace a little bit . . . I was certainly guilty of it when I was single I think. If you're single and you like a guy, and it's safe, approach him."[^9]

Macabre Storytelling's video has a pretty good guide on how to accomplish this with no BS.[^12]

### 3. Men are expected to take the initiative.
**If this were the perfect society, men and women would take initiative with equal frequency, and society would not treat any role as masculine or feminine. But this is not the case.**
We live in a patriarchal society. A patriarchy doesn't just deprive women of power. It forces power upon men who do not necessarily want it.[^5] 

One thing I have noticed is that üî¥ _**people tend not to fight sexism when it benefits them**_. Why is this?

In general, üî¥ _**people are far less likely to fight discrimination when it benefits them**_. Martin Luther King Junior often remarked that the greatest enemy to his movement was not the white supremacists, but the moderates, who seemed to tolerate some discrimination and harbored a lukewarm acceptance of black people, but did not want to see change happen too quickly.[^3] These people formed the bulk of America, and are the reason MLK Jr was unable to achieve his dream. (It is interesting to note that most people do not know that MLK Jr was a socialist. His image has been rewritten in history textbooks.)

"People tend not to fight sexism when it benefits them." Suppose there was a movement to actively introduce more female engineers into a company. A male job applicant would be much more likely to oppose this move. This is because it would hurt his chances of getting a job. But this movement will probably be a good thing if executed correctly. This is because a company with only male engineers will design around a "[[reference man]]," or the average male.

> But when a woman is involved in a car crash, she is 47% more likely to be seriously injured, and 71% more likely to be moderately injured, even when researchers control for factors such as height, weight, seatbelt usage, and crash intensity. She is also 17% more likely to die. And it‚Äôs all to do with how the car is designed ‚Äì and for whom.
> Source: [^4]

**Active attempts at inclusion are likely to meet resistance by whoever benefits from the status quo. Attempts to fight sexism, whether against men or women, are likely to meet resistance by whoever benefits from the status quo.**

Now we return to our analysis of the dating market. **Forcing men to take the initiative has interesting consequences.** For starters, women are deprived of the ability to control their fate other than a simple yes/no mechanism. In recent times, there has been a push to get women to take more initiative. I do not think this movement has seen significant success. **Bizarrely, there are many women who have opposed this movement, which would give them more power.** Could it be that they benefit from the status quo, because lacking initiative also means less effort and less vulnerability? Or perhaps they are willing to support it nominally, but are unwilling to risk social isolation by being a "thot?" It is sad to see that women who take initiative may be shunned by their fellow women. 

Let's take a look at 2 articles from Elite Daily.
The first article is "If You Really Liked Her, You'd Be The First One To Make A Move." The author is listed as "The Ambrose Girls."

#### Article 1: "If You Really Liked Her, You'd Be The First One To Make A Move"[^6]
> When a guy has a crush on a woman, the normal progression of action would look something like the following:
> 1. Ask her for her phone number.
> 2. Strike up a text conversation, or make a real phone call.
> 3. Ask her out on a date.
> 4. Plan the date.
> 5. Plan the second date while on the first. [It is interesting to note that step 5 places the power completely in the hands of the man. If he does not act at every step of the way, things will not progress.]
> We're starting to gather it just doesn't work in this simple, five-step process anymore these days. Why? We have no effing clue.
> Perhaps it's because the dating lines and rules have become so blurred, we don't know who should make the first move. Perhaps it's because men are starting to live in fear of being labeled as ‚Äúcreepy.‚Äù [This is true. I have seen men being called creepy without even flirting, and just talking to a woman normally.] Perhaps the guy simply doesn't know what to do, and he doesn't know how to figure out if she's interested. [This is also probably true. If only there was a manual that would break things down for you...]

So, here's a general PSA to the guys out there: If you have a crush on a girl (and she knows you do), but you do nothing to pursue her, a lot of things are going to run through her mind.[Note: If the guy hides his crush, she will NOT think these 3 things about him!] She's probably going to think one of these three really bad things about you: 1) You're lazy as f* ck, [**A man who is considered lazy is considered to have no future.**] 2) you don't have the confidence to make a move, which is super unattractive [**So lack of confidence is considered very unattractive. You heard it from the girls.**] or 3) your little ‚Äúcrush‚Äù isn't real.[Women hate fake feelings. If their partner falls out of love but does not cheat on them sexually, they likely still consider that betrayal.]

We know the above three assumptions sound judgmental, but quiet frankly, we don't care. [It is obvious the author is frustrated. ] We're sick and tired of hearing about guys who have crushes on girls, but sit and do nothing about them. We understand this isn't the 1950s, and women have just as much of an opportunity to make a move as guys do. But, when it comes to the casual world of dating, this shouldn't be used as an excuse. [It is interesting to note that the author presupposes the reader believes dating is casual. But what is more interesting is that "women can make moves too!" is considered an unacceptable reason.]

You need to be the pursuer. [This is the thesis of the article. Women want men to be the pursuer. This benefits them, since if more men pursued, then women would have much more success and choices available. The reverse is also true. If women were the pursuers, men would sit back and do nothing (ref the comments about being lazy). So now we have a weird standoff "no man's land" where men and women don't really feel like doing anything. It seems that everyone is jaded.]

We're over hearing our guy friends tell us about crushes they have yet to text or even respond to. ["Or even respond to" seems like a more serious sin because they supposedly have more opportunity] We're done with finding out a guy is interested in us through the grapevine. [The frustration is very real.] There are men out there who are bold enough to admit they have a crush to any listening ear, but they never act on it.[I have never heard of such men. People I know seem to keep their feelings to themself, as a way of avoiding vulnerability. But when I ask them about it, they may freely tell me about their struggles. But they don't tell the friends of the crush.] They don't tell the one person whom this information would matter to: their crush. [Said in this manner, this is quite convincing. Everyone has a set of key stakeholders they seek to satisfy. But the crush is the most important stakeholder in this context. ]

We seriously do not get it. We've had guys tell us to our faces they have a crush on one of our friends, but they never make a move.[Again, I have never heard of this.] We watch as they don't don't text her, don't call her and don't make any effort to ask her out. Yet, they say they have a "crush." [As stated previously, women hate fake feelings. In fact, women probably hate fake feelings most. It also seems like they deal with it, whether as perpetrators or victims, on a daily basis.]

Believe us, this isn't even some BS line they're using to get women to sleep with them. We've watched these same guys fail to initiate any sort of physical contact.
[The author attempts to make the men seem as pathetic as possible. And yet, this description fits the majority of male classmates I have known.]
So, in comes these other two assumptions. If he's not trying to flatter her in order to sleep with her, but he says he has a crush, does he even mean it? But then, why would he lie?

Does he keep this innocent crush at arm's length because he has a girlfriend or something? [Clearly not.] Is he waiting for her to give him an ‚Äúin,‚Äù [maybe] or is he just extremely lazy [very probably]?

All of these frustrating questions not only deter your crush from ever considering you,[ref the 3 cases mentioned earlier] but they also help her move right along to someone who actually does pursue her. [Because men have the initiative and women don't, women have to deal with "job applicants." If a superior candidate comes along that actually has initiative, she will most probably go with that one.]

If you really like a girl, you do not want this to happen. [Appealing to FOMO, feelings of competition] Sure, it might be scary [an understatement for many people, especially those who do not know a structured approach], but take a risk and put yourself out there.[The risks are understated. See below.] She very well might be worth it. It's not like you have a crush on her for no reason.

So, to conclude this strongly worded PSA to the gentlemen out there, when you have a crush on a girl, make the move. [Thesis reiteration, conclusion] Most women worth dating still wait for the guy to initiate something.[Still the 1990s, then.] So, don't hold your breath and wait for her to ask you out.

Most women want to feel desired and sought after, and begging a man to take you out on a date makes them feel the exact opposite.[Quite true.] Don't treat us like sh* t because you ‚Äúlike‚Äù us. Respond to our texts,[It would be baffling if a man did not do this. But for many people, they don't have meaningful contact in this manner. Or they get one-word responses...] listen to what we say and show us you care in a real way [Are the women venting their problems to these men?].

If you really have a genuine crush on a woman, make a move and be genuine with her. That's how you'll set yourself apart from the f* ckboys she's beyond sick of. [According to the article, even these are rare these days.] Then, you'll be the one to get a date. [Seems like a reasonable assumption. You heard it from the women.]

#### Article 2: "This Guy Has The Best Reason For Why He Never Asks Out Women"[^7]
[The author for this article is the same.]
A little bit ago we wrote an article on yours truly, Elite Daily, called ‚ÄúIf You Really Liked Her, You'd Be The First One To Make A Move.‚Äù The title here pretty much sums up the point of the article, but incase [sic] you need more of a clue in: Guys, just ask us out already. While we stand by our article and wholeheartedly still believe in every typed word within it, our stance on said article was recently challenged.

The challenger? A guy. OF COURSE. [This is quite unsurprising. People tend to oppose sexism when it goes against them.]

He didn't just casually disagree with our belief that the ‚Äúguy need to be the asker-outer.‚Äù He REALLY disagreed. In fact, he became sort of heated about it in the already hot 90-degree weather on his rooftop pool deck. [The previous article was kind of toxic and lacked perspective. Men cannot appreciate female issues (because they are not female) and women cannot appreciate male issues (because they are not male).]

Although this is a great guy friend of ours, and he is allowed to challenge our viewpoints on our published works with no offense taken, we were confused and taken aback. Just simply telling guys they need to be the pursuers is not that obscure, right? Wrong. [It is obscure because it goes completely against the female initiative movement that everyone has been (nominally) pushing for. Put simply, the previous article reinforces the patriarchy.]

Dying to know more, we started to grill this guy.

Let's set the stage for our guy friend. He is tall, successful, attractive, great personality and by far one of the best dinner dates in town. [Here we see the arhcetype of the ideal male. Assume tall, attractive, successful, and personality to have roughly equal weight for now. We may make adjustments to this model later. I do not know why height was listed separately from attractiveness.] But, he is single. Even as his best gal pals, we have NO clue how in the world this guy is single. He really has it all. [Evidently, he is jaded.]

He is the type of guy who is perfectly capable of walking into any bar and walking up to a girl and asking her out [Physical attractiveness plays the most important role here, as he can do it "cold"], yet he doesn't. [He is jaded.] He doesn't use dating apps because he thinks they are desperate and draw the wrong kind of attention. (We agree.) [This is likely true, as you will see later in the book] Further, he told us he is not likely to text first even if he really likes a girl, is not at all weirded out by a girl if she gives him ‚Äúthe double blow up‚Äù AND is flattered by and prefers girls going after him. [The author indicates their shock by using an all caps AND. But the truth is, all guys prefer the girls going after them, because things become a lot simpler. It is for the exact same reason that girls prefer chasing guys rather than being the chaser. Being the chaser is hard. ]

If you are thinking WHAT IN THE WORLD?! And WHY?! And wondering if our friend is a martian, we were too.[The lack of perspective is astounding.] We obvi [sic] needed more info so we dug deeper. Prepare, dear readers.

Revert back to the qualities we attributed to our guy in question. He has it all, remember? The reason he is so reluctant to chase and be the pursuer is quite simple. Upon further elaboration it made sense to us, and it can all be reverted back to one big dating clich√©. He is a classic ‚Äúgood on paper guy.‚Äù [As it turns out, men, like women, hate fake feelings. If someone evaluates him based on a rubric, she likes him objectively, but doesn't actually like him emotionally.]

He purposefully resists the chase, asking girls out and be the pursuer because little does he know, some day some chick might be lonely, bored AF, whose besties are all married and pregnant and think, ‚Äúwell, he keeps asking me out, he is good on paper, so even though I don't have real feelings for him I should just keep dating him.‚Äù

BOOM. mind blown.

He views girls coming after him as a sign of genuine affection, versus feeling like he's ‚Äúmaking‚Äù a girl like him.[Incidentally, many guys want to know how to "make" girls like them. There has been a rise in popularity of the "dating guru industry" who teach "game."]

This is so true. As relationship bloggers, we know that relationship ‚Äúrules‚Äù and articles such as the ones we write are never black and white and set in stone; there are grey areas everywhere.

Case in point right here. Dating and putting yourself out there is just as scary for guys as it is for us girls. If we were him, we would be terrified to chase after someone who might not be there for the right reasons just to ‚Äúsettle‚Äù and check off the boxes in their all important list of things to accomplish before 40. [Get married before 40 is the implied goal.]

A girl chasing him tells him everything he needs to appease his fears. A girl coming on to him makes him feel like they actually want him for him, that he's not forcing someone to like him. They want to be with him because of who he is IRL; they want to see him and go on dates with him because they WANT to spend time to getting to know him. He is comforted by the idea that a girl wouldn't seek him out if she were doing so solely in hopes of fulfilling a void.

This is a tough situation where both he, and our article have conflicting points, but they can be drawn together. Girls want the guy to be the pursuer, they want to be asked out on dates and they are frustrated when guys don't follow the ‚Äúrules‚Äù and ask them out. [If guys avoid asking out a girl, she may feel unwanted as no one is "applying for her." Imagine if a company was unable to secure any employees when putting out a "help wanted."] However, if a really really great guy who is not pass-up-able comes along, girls should most definitely consider changing the golden rules of dating and put themselves out there for the guy. [You read it from her. If the guy is a 10, girls will be motivated to pursue. Otherwise, the "golden rules" are maintained. The "golden rules" happen to be an enforcement of the parts of the patriarchy beneficial for them.]

This is his point: If a girl really is interested in him, and not caught up in all he has and who he is on paper, she will put in some of the grunt work to get his attention in a real way. The others who are in it for the wrong reasons will give up eventually and move along with their lives.

Dating is a tough world to navigate, and this really throws a monkey wrench in our firm beliefs of waiting around for a guy to ask us out. [Assumption here is that girls just need to go to some social place and wait there for hours each time.] However stuck on this process we are, we both fully admit if an amazing guy came around, there is zero chance we would sit idly by and wait for him. [Obviously not, he would be a 10 in high demand. Like how when someone reaches a certain point in their career, recruiters approach them.] It's definitely not our favorite fantasy about finding love, but it sure is one that can happen [The fantasy is to be romantically approached by a tall, attractive, successful man with a great personality].
