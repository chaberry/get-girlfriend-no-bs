# Approaches to Getting a Girlfriend

## First Things First
First, we need to get some things out of the way.
Are you an incel?
This is usually a tough question to answer, as a positive answer would hurt the ego and bring a lot of stigma.
According to blackpill theory, a man's attractiveness is determined primarily by looks.

An incel, by definition, is someone who is physically unattractive to the point that no matter how good their personality is, they will never find a mate.

As we can see, only a small minority of people actually fall into this category. 

Now, what about everyone else?
Many people mistakenly think "I don't have a girlfriend despite wanting one, therefore I am an incel." That's not the way this works.
Such people are simply classified as "normie-cels." Whenever a normiecel claims to be an incel, they may get flamed for trying to downplay themself. The difference in success rates between a normiecel and an incel is measured in orders of magnitude. As a result, someone who incorrectly claims to be an incel may arouse animosity.

## What is a good timeframe?
According to Dr. K (HealthyGamerGG) in his video "Talking with an Incel about Starting a Relationship," it takes about 18 months for a person who is seeking a girlfriend to get a girlfriend.[^1]
